Set Up Flutter Project with Navigation\n\nDescription:\nAs a developer, I want to create a Flutter project with a structured boilerplate, including a bottom navigation bar, so that the app is clean, modular, and ready for future features.\n\nPoint Value: 3\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- The app launches with a blank screen.\n- A bottom navigation bar is present but empty.\n- The project follows Flutter best practices for structuring widgets and navigation.\n- The code is clean, modular, and follows state management best practices.\n\nDefinition of Done (DoD):\n- Code is committed and pushed to the repository.\n- The app runs successfully on an emulator/device without errors.\n- Navigation structure is set up, even if tabs are empty.\n- The project is structured for scalability and maintainability.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements:\n- Performance: The app should launch within 2 seconds.\n- Code Quality: Code must follow Flutterâ€™s best practices and be properly documented.\n- Scalability: The structure should support adding new features without major refactoring.","iid":9,"updated_by_id":1345,"weight":null,"confidential":false,"due_date":null,"lock_version":3,"time_estimate":0,"relative_position":5708,"last_edited_at":"2025-02-17T13:48:55.113-05:00","last_edited_by_id":1345,"discussion_locked":null,"closed_at":null,"closed_by_id":null,"health_status":null,"external_key":null,"issue_type":"issue","state":"opened","events":[{"project_id":1777,"author_id":1345,"created_at":"2025-02-10T14:06:55.764-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-10T14:06:55.764-05:00","action":"created","target_type":"Issue","fingerprint":null}],"timelogs":[],"notes":[{"note":"changed

Feedback\n\nDescription:\nAs a user, I want the Qibla Finder to indicate when I am correctly facing the Qibla, so that I know exactly when I am aligned for prayer.\n\nPoint Value: 5\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- The Qibla direction is calculated based on the userâ€™s location and displayed on the compass.\n- A visual indicator (e.g., glowing green highlight) appears when the user is correctly facing the Qibla.\n- If the user is not aligned, the UI subtly guides them to adjust their position.\n\nDefinition of Done (DoD):\n- The Qibla direction updates dynamically as the user rotates their device.\n- The indicator turns green when the user is facing the correct direction.\n- The experience is tested across different locations to ensure accuracy.\n- Code is committed and pushed to the repository.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements:\n- Accuracy: The Qibla direction must have a maximum deviation of Â±1Â°.\n- User Experience: The transition between incorrect and correct alignment should be smooth and non-disruptive.","iid":15,"updated_by_id":1345,"weight":null,"confidential":false,"due_date":null,"lock_version":1,"time_estimate":0,"relative_position":5763,"last_edited_at":"2025-02-17T13:45:42.052-05:00","last_edited_by_id":1345,"discussion_locked":null,"closed_at":null,"closed_by_id":null,"health_status":null,"external_key":null,"issue_type":"issue","state":"opened","events":[{"project_id":1777,"author_id":1345,"created_at":"2025-02-17T13:42:20.958-05:00","updated_at":"2025-02-17T13:42:20.958-05:00","action":"created","target_type":"Issue","fingerprint":null}],"timelogs":[],"notes":[{"note":"marked

Value: 5\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- A calibration prompt appears when the user opens the Qibla Finder.\n- Instructions for calibrating the deviceâ€™s compass are displayed clearly.\n- After calibration, the compass accuracy is improved, and the user is notified.\n\nDefinition of Done (DoD):\n- The calibration process is easy to follow and does not require unnecessary steps.\n- The feature is tested to ensure improved compass accuracy after calibration.\n- The calibration prompt does not appear redundantly after the user has already calibrated.\n- Code is committed and pushed to the repository.\n\nNon-Functional Requirements:\n- User Experience: Instructions should be clear and concise to avoid user confusion.\n- Performance: Calibration should take less than 10 seconds to
