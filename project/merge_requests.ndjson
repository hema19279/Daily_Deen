The contents\n-          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n-          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n-          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n-          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n-          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n-          as modifying the License.\n-\n-      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n-      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n-      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n-      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n-      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n-      the conditions stated in this License.\n-\n-   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n-      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n-      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n-      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n-      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n-      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n-      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n-\n-   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n-      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n-      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n-      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n-\n-   7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n-      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n-      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n-      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n-      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n-      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n-      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n-      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n-      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n-      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n-      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n-\n-   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n-      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n-      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n-      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n-      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n-      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n-      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n-      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n-      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n-      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n-\n-   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n-\n-   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n-\n-      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n-      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n-      replaced with your own identifying information.
